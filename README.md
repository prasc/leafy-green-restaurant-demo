# LEAFY GREEN RESTAURANT

This is a demo website I created for a potential Vegan restaurant based in Toronto. The inspiration for this website is to showcase my skills in design, best practices, and respnsive web design.

## Technologies used

This website was created using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JS. I incorporated industry approved best practice such as semantic HTML, WCAG Accessbility, and responsive design. I also incorporated a CSS pre-processor, SASS, to help with styling.
