# LEAFY GREEN RESTAURANT

This is a demo website I created for a potential Vegan restaurant based in Toronto. The inspiration for this website is to showcase my skills in design, best practices, and semantic HTML.

## Technologies used

This website was created using HTML5, CSS3, and SASS. I incorporated industry approved best practice such as semantic HTML, WCAG Accessbility, and external stylesheets.
